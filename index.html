<p id="PI">A Disease is a condition that is abnormal and negatively affects the structure and functioning of organs or tissues or parts of a living organism. It has to be noted that it is not due to any immediate external injury and disease is a medical condition that has specific signs and symptoms.</p> 


<p id="PI">Therefore, it can be stated that a disease is a discomfortable condition that deteriorates the normal functioning of the cells, organs, and tissues.</p>

<p id="PI">OR</p>

<p id="PI">Any risk caused due to divergence from the normal or functional state of an entity can be termed as a disease.</p>


<p id="PI">Any adverse variation from an organism's normal structural or functional condition is usually associated with specific signs and symptoms and distinct from physical injury. A diseased organism will frequently display indications or symptoms that indicate its aberrant state. To recognize the symptoms of sickness, one must first understand the normal state of an organism. Nonetheless, there isn't always a clear line between disease and wellness.</p><br><br>

	<h2><li>Acute Disease</li></h1>
	<p id="PI">A few diseases appear out of nowhere and persist only a few days. Acute diseases, such as the common cold, are examples of them. Medical treatment or self-treatment are also options for treating this illness. Acute diseases frequently become chronic if they are not treated.</p>

<p id="PI">Acute illnesses can affect any part of the body. An asthma episode, for example, is acute and then becomes chronic. Acute diseases include strep throat, fractured bones, appendicitis, influenza, pneumonia, and others.
</p><br>
<h2 ><li>Symptoms and Treatments</li></h1>

<p id="PI">Acute diseases develop quickly and are accompanied by unique symptoms that necessitate immediate or short-term treatment and improve once treated. A fractured bone, for example, that may occur as a result of a fall, must be treated by a doctor and will recover over time. Acute illnesses, such as the common cold, can sometimes go away on their own. The majority of those who suffer from acute illnesses will recover quickly. If you've been hospitalized for an acute illness, you'll probably be ready to get back to the comfort and familiarity of the home once your condition improves. However, just because you've been released from the hospital doesn't imply you've entirely recovered. Find out what steps you may take to speed up your return to your regular routine.</p><br><br>
