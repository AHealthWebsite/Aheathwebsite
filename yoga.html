		<h1 id="h1" >Yoga explained</h1><br>
<p id="PI">Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.</p><br>

<p id="PI">Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.</p><br>

<p id="PI">The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.</p><br>

<p id="PI">The movements of yoga are designed to challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the function of body and mind.</p><br>

<p id="PI">Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.</p><br>
